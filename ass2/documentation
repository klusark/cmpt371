1: No Loss. Everything worked as expected

4: Testing on a remote machine worked as expected. If I made the server have no
   delay, the ping numbers were around 5 ms higher than they were using the ping
   utility

5: Timing. The timing is off by around 50ms at most for the 10 pings. If you
   look at the total time given by each call, it is always 10000 + time for the
   last packet.

6: Long delay. 0% loss and 1000ms delay on average. This one created issues for
   me at first, but I fixed them by checking the seq number, and resetting the
   timeout if I need to keep listening. All the packets that should be received
   are received and there are no false positives.
