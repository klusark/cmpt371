CMPT371 Programming Assignment #1

I implemented the proxy as described in the assignment. I also decided to fix a
few issues that the original code has.

1. I removed the static buffer. Instead of buffering the entire file, I read
   from the socket input and them immidiately write to the output socket.
   Optimally this would occur on two seperate threads in order to maximize
   performance, but I did not think it nessicary.

2. I split the connection logic into a seperate thread (ProxyCacheTread.java).
   This immensly improves the responsivness of the proxy when used by a browser.
   Before, the client would need to wait for whatever request is currently being
   processed to finish before it starts on the next one, but this can cuase
   major issues if a server times out, or if there are a large number of
   resources that the browser expects to be fetching at the same time. This also
   has the added benefit of limiting thrown expeptions and the subsiquent error
   handling to the thread that the error occurs on.

3. I implemented the HEAD request method. I was going to try to implement POST,
   but it seems to me that the Proxy Server was written only with GET in mind,
   making it rather annoying to try to retrofit it with POST support.


I was not really a fan of this assignment. For a third year course I think it is
fair to expect people to be able to use any language you want them to. I also
would much rather have implemented the entire ProxyServer from scratch myself. I
think that would have been a better learning oppertunity for me. I finished the
assignment as defined on the website during the class it was assigned, but spent
a few more hours working on the additions above. I really love long challening
programming assignments. I really hope Programming Assignment #2 will be one of
them.
